Codes description

### myAppSettings folders

* `Emacs4general`: These settings are tested by [Cygwin][cygwin] on Windows 7 platform in command line mode (CLI).  
   ***General*** means that is was created for general purposes.  
   **Note :** The actual settings files are located in `~/.emacs.d/settings` and separated by sense.  
   The main config file is `.emacs` located in the home directory.  

* `Emacs4python`: These settings are tested by [Cygwin][cygwin] on Windows 7 platform in command line mode (CLI). They are specific for [Python][python] programming and used for own entertainment. GNU [Emacs][emacs] is old enough editor with strong power. Because of Emacs is using the [Lisp][lisp] programming language, the settings may look complicated.

   **Note :** The actual settings files are located in `~/.emacs.d/settings` and separated by sense.  
   The main config file is `.emacs` located in the home directory.  
   The plugins version **MUST** be changed according your real version in your setting files.  
   The settings are RAW, so may work incorrectly. Any tips are **WELCOME**.
